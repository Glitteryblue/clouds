            <h3> A House for Everyone </h3><br>
            <p>You might belong in Gryffindor,
            Where dwell the brave at heart,
            Their daring, nerve, and chivalry,
            Set Gryffindors apart;</p> <br>
           <p>You might belong in Hufflepuff,
            Where they are just and loyal,
            Those patient Hufflepuffs are true,
            And unafraid of toil;</p> <br>
            <p> Yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
            If you've a ready mind,
            Where those of wit and learning,
            Will always find their kind; <p> <br>
            <p>Or perhaps in Slytherin,
            You'll make your real friends,
            These cunning folks use any means
            To achieve their ends.‚Äù </p>

        <h3>Learning to be Responsible</h3> <br>
    <p> Hogwarts has many opportunities for students to challenge themselves and develop their interests.</p> <br>
       <p> We foster team work and responsibility through our annual inter-house championship, where students earn points for their houses through hard work and good behaviour.</p> <br>
       <p> Equally, students may lose points for their house through breaking school rules. </p><br>

        <h3>Fighting the Dark Arts</h3><br>
        <p> Graciously returned to its former glory, Hogwarts was the location of the final battle between
            the darkest wizard of all time, Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter. </p> <br>
         <p> Naturally, a battle of such ferocity caused a considerable amount of damage to this historical site, however, this was easily repaired by a skilled team of wizards</p> <br>
         <p>We are now the proud home of a memorial, to remember those who lost their lives in the great battle.</p><br>
